I am excited to present my very first web development project: an innovative application designed to facilitate the connection between clients and artisans. This project was built using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and incorporates several technologies such as the RandomUser API, asynchronous functions, IndexedDB, and Local Storage for data management.

Project Overview
Objective: The application aims to create a platform where each user has a personalized portal based on their role, either as a client or an artisan.

Features:

Client Portal: Clients have access to an interactive table listing all available artisans along with their respective professions. Through this interface, clients can view artisan profiles and choose the one that best meets their needs. Once an artisan is selected, clients can easily schedule an appointment by confirming their preferred date and time.

Artisan Portal: Artisans also have their own portal where they can view a summary table of all orders placed by clients. This table enables artisans to track and manage requests effectively.

Technologies Used:

Vanilla JavaScript: For application logic and dynamic interactions.
HTML & CSS: For the structure and styling of the application.
RandomUser API: To generate random user data cost-effectively.
Asynchronous Functions: To handle background operations and improve application responsiveness.
IndexedDB: For structured client-side data storage, allowing efficient management of artisan and client information.
Local Storage: To store user preferences and temporary information, ensuring a smooth and continuous user experience.
How It Works:

When a client logs in, they access an overview of artisans with options to filter and select those of interest. The client can then schedule an appointment online.
When an artisan logs in, they see a table containing all client orders. This allows the artisan to track request statuses, confirm or modify appointments, and manage their schedule efficiently
